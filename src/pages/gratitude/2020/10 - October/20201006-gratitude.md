1. I'm grateful for a patient therapist who challenges me and helps me gain insights into my own emotions and reactions to them.
2. I love my girls. Had a nice chat with Skye last night, and this morning Jenna left a note on my desk wishing me a good morning. I am fortunate to have wonderful progeny who love me.
3. I'm grateful to be alive, to have abundant opportunity and health and friends. I feel incredibly fortunate and grateful.
