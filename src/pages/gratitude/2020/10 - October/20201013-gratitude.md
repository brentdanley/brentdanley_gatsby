1. Skye has been calling me every evening to chat and discuss the day's news. I really enjoy this time, and her. I'm grateful we have a close relationship and care deeply about each other.
2. I have two job interviews today. Grateful for that. 
3. It's raining. I appreciate the many ways water refreshes and revitalizes the natural world.
