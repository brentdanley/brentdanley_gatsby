1. I'm grateful for friends who reach out to say hi and see how I'm doing. 
2. Went for a walk in the cemetery. It's so beautiful. I'm grateful for my healty, and to live on a beautiful planet.
3. I'm really happy Hayley and Jenna live with me in the loft. Their presence makes the loft feel like a home where family is, and I love it.
