1. I'm grateful for the big windows in my loft, which overlook the trees and gives me a great view of the sunrise.
2. Had wonderful conversations with Hayley and Jenna yesterday. They're wicked smart and thoughtful and good. I'm proud of the humans they are.
3. Grateful for friends who encourage, support, and inspire me. They're thoughtful and kind.
