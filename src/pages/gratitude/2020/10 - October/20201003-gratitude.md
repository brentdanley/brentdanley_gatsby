1. I'm grateful for my friends who text, call, send letters, and take the time to meet up with me for coffee and a conversation. I crave connection.
2. Living in a time and country where it's okay to disagree, and where the free exchange of ideas is frictionless, is wonderful and good. 
3. I'm grateful for clinical psychologists who offer insights and guidance and who improve the lives of myself and my girls in myriad and substantial ways.
