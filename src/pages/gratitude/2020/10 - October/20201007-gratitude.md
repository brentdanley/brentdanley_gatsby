1. I am grateful for my friends, who lift me up and make me smile. I appreciate the texts and phone calls. 
2. I love discussing the news and global events, and philosophy, with the girls. Skye calls me every night to discuss. 
3. I appreciate living in such a beautiful place. Every time I'm out or look out the window I'm in awe at just how marvelous is the place I live, and how very fortunate I am to live here.
