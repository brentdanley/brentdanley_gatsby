1. I am grateful that Jenna is back in my life, and that she is living here at the loft with me and Hayley. 
2. I'm glad Hayley is back from Illinois. I missed her.
3. I'm grateful for social media and the people with whom I've connected and made real friendships.
4. I planted cooking herbs with Hayley today, which was nice. I'm grateful for the little things in my life.
5. I love to code, and grateful for a career that's intellectually challenging and creative.
