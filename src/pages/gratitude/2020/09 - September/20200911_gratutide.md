1. Had lunch with Jenna. I'm daily grateful that she's back in my life and that she seems to genuinely enjoy my company.
2. Spent time with my buddy at my loft this morning. Grateful for people in my life and their time.
3. I'm grateful to live in Maine, where it's gorgeous at every season with many things to do and ways to be active.
4. Learning the Adobe Suite of creative products. I'm grateful for my brain and relative privilege that affords these pursuits.
