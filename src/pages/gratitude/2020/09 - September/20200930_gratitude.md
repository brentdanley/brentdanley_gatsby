1. Watched the first presidential debate with Jenna and Hayley last evening. I'm grateful for them, and their strong, smart opinions. They're fun.
2. Having coffee with a friend this morning who I've wanted to connect with in a more meaningful way for years. Excited about that.
3. I have an amazing therapist, who offers insights that sharpen my lens and helps me to understand and navigate my world and relationships that ultimately improves my life in important ways.
