1. Super grateful that Jenna is living here at the loft and in my life. I love our conversations and seeing her laugh with Hayley. I love when she asks me for my opinion on world events and philosophical ideas; she really seems to want to have conversations with me and a strong relationship.
2. Went on a date tonight. Grateful for our conversations and the connection.
