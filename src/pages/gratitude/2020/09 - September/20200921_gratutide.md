1. Grateful for my girls. Jenna asks me how I'm doing and gives me hugs occasionally. Talked to Skye on the phone today, which was nice.
2. I'm grateful for the mental health journey I'm on and all the things that got me here, including the trauma and heartbreak. I feel optimistic about my life, and powerful in my discoveries.
3. Thankful for my friends, both online, in real life, and those I'm meeting in my Transcend course. The world is filled with thoughtful, positive, kind, understanding, compassionate persons.
